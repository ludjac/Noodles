1. Yato Mee-Goreng 
------------------ 

Dry (!) Ramen Noodles  

Didnt realize they were dry noodles when i bought them. I am in the market for
noodle soup so I made a soup anyway.  

**Spicyness: 2/10**  
**Noodles: 7/10**  
**Richness: 5/10**  
**Flavour: 7/10**  
**Buy-again: 6/10**    

Good soup. Not a lot of flavour. Oily is a plus. I'll def enjoy them.  The
taste is good but a little weak.

2. Samyang Ramen Sutah 
---------------------- 

Hot&Spicy Flavour  

**Spicyness: 8/10**  
**Noodles: 5/10**  
**Richness: 7/10**  
**Flavour: 8/10**  
**Buy-again: 8/10**  

Very good soup. Almost perfect spicyness. slightly strong. Noodles are a bit
tasteless. No broth is a minus on the richness, only powder and garnish.

3. Kong Shi Fan Chicken Noodle 
----------------------

**Spicyness: 3/10**  
**Noodles: 8/10**  
**Richness: 9/10**  
**Flavour: 8/10**  
**Buy-again: 9/10**  

First time Kong Shi Fan chicken soup. Very rich taste, but does it taste
Chicken? Nevermind, Kong Shi Fan delivers outstanding tasting noodles as usual.
The noodles are not spicy at all, but still rich in flavour. Would buy again.
